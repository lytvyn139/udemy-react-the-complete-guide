# Why react ?
* UI state becomes difficult to handle with the Vanilla JS
* Focus on business logic not on preventing your App from exploding
* Huge ecosystem, active community, high performance

# React Alternatives
* Angular
* Vue

# Two kind of applications

## Single page app applications
only one HTML page, content is rendered on client, is most popular and modern. The page is filled with component, and every component is React  component. Typically one ReactDOM.render() calll

## Multi page applications
Multiple HTML pages, content is rendered on server. Normal HTML and CSS, and some image gallery is made with React. One ReactDOM.render() call per 'widget'
